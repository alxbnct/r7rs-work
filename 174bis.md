## Abstract

These procedures, except for those in the section **Conversions**,
have the same semantics as the
[SRFI 19](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-19/srfi-19.html)
procedures with the same names.
Their SRFI 174 equivalents are shown.

## Constants

No SRFI 174 equivalents, because SRFI 174 provides only timespecs
of type `time-utc`.

`time-utc`  
Symbol representing UTC time.

`time-tai`  
Symbol representing TAI time.

`time-monotonic`  
Symbol representing monotonic time.

`time-process`  
Symbol representing time spent in current process.

`time-thread`  
Symbol representing time spent in current thread.

`time-duration`  
Symbol representing a duration.

## Time object and accessors

`make-time` *type nanosecond second -> time*

Creates a time object.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec`]

`time?` *object -> boolean*

#t if object is a time object, otherwise, #f.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec?`]

`time-type` *time -> time-type*

Time type.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]

`time-nanosecond` *time -> integer*

Time nanosecond.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec-nanoseconds`]

`time-second` *time -> integer*

Time second.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec-seconds`]

## Time comparison procedures

All of the time comparison procedures require the time objects to be of the same type.
It is an error to use these procedures on time objects of different types.

The semantics for time objects of type `time-duration` are given in parentheses.

`time=?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*

#t if time1 is at (equal to) time2, #f otherwise.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec=?`]

`time<?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*

#t if time1 is before (less than) time2, #f otherwise.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec<?`]

`time>?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*

#t if time1 is after (greater than) time2, #f otherwise.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]

`time<=?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*

#t if time1 is before or at (less than or equal to) time2, #f otherwise.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]

`time>=?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*

#t if time1 is at or after (greater than or equal to) time2, #f otherwise.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]


## Time arithmetic procedures

`time-difference` *time1 time2 -> time-duration*

Returns a time object of type `time-duration` representing the time between
between *time1* and *time2*.
It is an error if time1 and time2 are of different time types. A new time object is created.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]

`add-duration` *time1 time-duration -> time*

Returns the time resulting from adding *time-duratio*n to *time*.
The result has the same type as *time*.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]

`subtract-duration` *time1 time-duration -> time*

Returns the time resulting from subtracting *time-duratio*n from *time*.
The result has the same type as *time*.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]

## Conversion

`time->inexact` *time*

Number of seconds since the epoch as an inexact real number.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec->inexact`]

`inexact->time` *type inexact*

A time with given type with specified number of seconds from the epoch.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `ineact->timespec`]

`time-utc->tai` *time* [*leap-second*]

Returns a time object of type `time-utc` to an equivalent time object
of type `time-tai`.  If the `time-utc` object is equivalent
to two different `time-tai` objects, one of which is a leap second and
the other of which is not, the boolean argument *leap-second* shows
which TAI second is returned.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]

`time-tai->utc` *time*

Converts a time object of type `time-tai` to an equivalent time object
of type `time-utc`.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]

## Hash and comparator

`time-hash` *time*

Returns an exact integer hash code for *time*.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec-hash`]

`time-comparator`  

A SRFI 128 comparator for two times of the same type
based on `time?, time=?, time<', time-hash`.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]
