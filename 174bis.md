## Introduction

These functions, except for those in the section **Conversions**,
have the same semantics as the SRFI 19 procedures of the same names.
Their SRFI 174 equivalents are shown.

## Constants

No SRFI 174 equivalents, because SRFI 174 provides only timespecs
of type `time-utc`.

`time-duration`  
Symbol representing Time duration.

`time-monotonic`  
Symbol representing monotonic time.

`time-process`  
Symbol representing time spent in current process.

`time-tai`  
Symbol representing TAI time.

`time-thread`  
Symbol representing time spent in current thread.

`time-utc`  
Symbol representing UTC time.


## Time object and accessors

`make-time` *type nanosecond second -> time*  
Creates a time object.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec`]

`time?` *object -> boolean*  
#t if object is a time object, otherwise, #f.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec?`]


`time-type` *time -> time-type*
Time type.
[No SRFI 174 equivalent]

`time-nanosecond` *time -> integer*  
Time nanosecond.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec-nanoseconds`]

`time-second` *time -> integer*  
Time second.
[[SRFI 174](https://srfi.schemergs.org/srfi-174/srfi-174.html) `timespec-seconds`]


## Time comparison procedures
All of the time comparison procedures require the time objects to be of the same type.
It is an error to use these procedures on time objects of different types.

The semantics for time objects of type `time-duration` are given in parentheses.

`time<=?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*  
#t if time1 is before or at (less than or equal to) time2, #f otherwise.

`time<?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*  
#t if time1 is before (less than) time2, #f otherwise.

`time=?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*  
#t if time1 at (equal) time2, #f otherwise.

`time>=?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*  
#t if time1 is at or after (greater than or equal to) time2, #f otherwise.

`time>?` *time1 time2 -> boolean*  
#t if time1 is after (greater than) time2, #f otherwise.

## Time arithmetic procedures

`time-difference` *time1 time2 -> time-duration*  
Returns a time object of type `time-duration` representing the time between
between time1 and time2. It is an error if time1 and time2 are of different time types. A new time object is created.

`add-duration` *time1 time-duration -> time*  
The time resulting from adding time-duration to time1, which is a time object of the same time type as time1. A new time object is created.

`subtract-duration` *time1 time-duration -> time*  
The time resulting from subtracting time-duration to time1, which is a time object of the same time type as time1. A new time object is created.

## Conversion

`time->inexact` *time*  
Number of seconds since the epoch as an inexact real number.

`inexact->time` *type inexact*  
A time with given type with specified number of seconds from the epoch.

`time-utc->tai` *time* [*leap-second*]

Converts a time object of type `time-utc` to an equivalent time object
of type `time-tai`.  If the `time-utc` object is equivalent
to two different `time-tai` objects, one of which is a leap second and
the other of which is not, the boolean argument *leap-second* shows
which TAI second is returned.

`time-tai->utc` *time*

Converts a time object of type `time-tai` to an equivalent time object
of type `time-utc`.

## Hash procedure

`time-comparator`  

A SRFI 128 comparator for two times of the same type.
