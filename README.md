# r7rs-work

If you are interested in implementing any of the R7RS-large projects described in this repo,
please take the following steps:

1. Not everything described here is intended as part of R7RS-large.
   Look at [the Committee B dockets](CommitteeBDockets.md) and pick something
   that interests you.
   
1. The ones that are marked "SRFI nnn" or have a link "Implementation" don't need
   to be worked on.  Currently the Urania, Selene, and Pan dockets are the
   relevant ones.
   
1. If you can't choose which project you want to work on, pick the one nearer
   the top of the page, but don't be too concerned about it.  Any project is fine.
   
1. File a GitHub issue saying which project you are working on right away, so that
   there isn't any contention between volunteers.
   
1. As soon as possible, add a link to the repo you are working in.  It doesn't have to
   be a GitHub repo.  
   
1. If you have to give up on a project, close the issue, but don't delete your repo
   unless it is empty.
