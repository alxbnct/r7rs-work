R6RS recommends that square brackets
(which are equivalent to parens) be used
to wrap these syntactic constructs:

 * `cond`, `case` `case-lambda`, and `guard` clauses
 * bindings for `let` and friends and for `do`
 * `syntax-rules`, `syntax-case`, and `identifier-syntax` clauses
 
 Of course none of these are mandatory,
 but they have become conventional to some degree.
