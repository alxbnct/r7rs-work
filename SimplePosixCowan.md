## Interfaces

WG2 voted to provide a Posix package, but rejected a "full Posix" package that would provide all 81
headers, 1191 interfaces, and 51 data types from POSIX.
For the current proposal, see
[SRFI 170](htmlpreview.github.io?https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-170/srfi-170.html)
